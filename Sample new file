###Workshop at TCWORLD - 2018

1. To enable scenarios based on software documentation, such as machine learning, search and retrieval, having high quality metadata for your content often is the key differentiator between success and failure.


1. To build high quality content that is ready to be used in an intelligent way, a technical communicator often need to provide some form of pre-classified content metadata. The best way to collect and organize such metadata, is by developing a taxonomy. In this workshop you with learn how to build your first taxonomy.

In this workshop you will learn:

- a strategy for creating your first taxonomy


- why you, as a technical communicator, are in the best position to define it


Enjoy!
